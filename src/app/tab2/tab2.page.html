      During the Meiji era, Japanese cloisonn√© enamel reached a technical peak, producing items more advanced than any
      that had existed before. The period from 1890 to 1910 was known as the "Golden age" of Japanese enamels.
      Artists experimented with pastes and with the firing process to produce ever larger blocks of enamel, with less
      need for cloisons (enclosing metal strips).

      The Terracotta Army is a fascinating aspect of Ancient Chinese art. It was created for the burial of the first
      Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, in order to protect him in the afterlife. It consists of thousands of
      sculptures that make up an army of soldiers. There were sculptures of over 8,000 soldiers and 520 horses in the
      terracotta army. These weren't tiny sculptures either. All 8,000 soldiers were life-sized! They had details too,
      including uniforms, weapons, armor, and each soldier even had his own unique face.
